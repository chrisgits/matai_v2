          The forensic science of collision reconstruction goes far beyond that which is learned in traditional training. Understanding physics and mathematics, and developing proficiency in those disciplines is only the foundation. The factors which contribute to the cause of collisions are often far more complex than simply determining speed or understanding the basics of time and distance.
          <br>
          Nighttime collisions pose a special set of problems which a Collision Reconstructionist needs to approach with both an appreciation for that which may seem obvious but is not, and a plan as to
          how best to analyze the often complex variables they are presented with.

          Understanding visibility and how to document this evidence is key to forming a solid opinion as to causal factors in nighttime vehicle collisions.
